topic-modeling-lda-vem-v1.ipynb: R Jupyter notebook implementing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm for topic modeling (Variational Expectation-Maximization -VEM also called Variational Bayes - VB) version. The texts are the contents of the Statistics Explained (SE) Glossary articles, as stored in the Knowledge Database (KD).
Interactive notebook: Binder

An interactive version of this document is in Kaggle, here. Pressing Copy and Edit (upper right part of the screen) allows to edit the document and experiment with it, without signing-in. Unfortunately, the "usual" procedure of producing a Docker image from Binder was failing because the package "topicmodels" could not be loaded. Support for R and R packages in Jupyter notebooks is not very good.
