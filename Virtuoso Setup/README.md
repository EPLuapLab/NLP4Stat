* Preferably version 7.2 for 64-bit machines which is available [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/virtuoso/files/latest/download). The link in the table above seems to be broken. Run the installer as administrator and accept the defaults. The default installation is shown below:

![Virtuoso setup2](Virtuoso_setup2.JPG). 

* With this default installation as example:
    *  Go to the system environment variables and add C:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\Virtuoso OpenSource 7.2\bin and C:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\Virtuoso OpenSource 7.2\lib to the system PATH variable.
    *  Crete a new system variable VIRTUOSO_HOME with value C:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\Virtuoso OpenSource 7.2\
