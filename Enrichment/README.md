**A. tests_topic_mod_v1.md**: Markdown document with title "Topic modelling: tests with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm". 

An **interactive version** of this document is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/spiliopoulos/topic-modeling-lda/notebook). Pressing **Copy and Edit** (upper right part of the screen) allows to edit the document and experiment with it, **without signing-in**. Unfortunately, the "usual" procedure of producing a Docker image from Binder was failing because the package "topicmodels" could not be loaded. Support for R and R packages in Jupyter notebooks is not very good. 

**B. /LDA_2/tests_topic_mod_pack_lda.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook of an alternative implementation of the LDA algorithm using the textmineR package (the interpretation of the topics in the end is not yet updated).

**Interactive notebook**:

(the interpretation of the topics in the end is not yet updated).
