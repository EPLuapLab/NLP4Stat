**A. topic-modeling-lda-vem-v1.ipynb**: R Jupyter notebook implementing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm for topic modeling (Variational Expectation-Maximization -VEM) version. 

An **interactive version** of this document is **[here](https://www.kaggle.com/spiliopoulos/topic-modeling-lda-vem-v1)**. Pressing **Copy and Edit** (upper right part of the screen) allows to edit the document and experiment with it, **without signing-in**. Unfortunately, the "usual" procedure of producing a Docker image from Binder was failing because the package "topicmodels" could not be loaded. Support for R and R packages in Jupyter notebooks is not very good. 

**B. /LDA_2/tests-topic-mod-altern-v1.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook of an alternative implementation of the LDA algorithm using the textmineR package and some more results. The topics are quite similar with the ones with algorithm A. Also, transferred to Kaggle, see **[here](https://www.kaggle.com/spiliopoulos/tests-topic-mod-altern-v1-md)**.

**C. /Spacy_NER/Glossary_NamedEntities_V2.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with test of the Spacy NER engine on the SE Glossary articles.
